## Day 3
10 July 2023: Project: [Survey Form](https://hangjoni.github.io/webdev/survey-form/index.html). Completed the html part. Will work on CSS part tomorrow. Had fun playing on flexboxfroggy.com while learning CSS.
## Learning Notes
- In VSCode, when editting html, after typing = , VSCode will create the quotes automatically and put the prompt in between the quotes. No need to type the quote, because if you do, you’ll find your prompt outside of the pair of quotes, then having to go backward inside the quote is rather inconvenient. This reddit thread explains this behavior very well.
- I figure text editor choice and typing speed is a major productivity enabler for web developers. Today I tried using “vim” mode inside VSCode and found it helps reduce typing time so much. I found using “vim” mode especially useful for copy pasting blocks of code, editting elements that vary just slightly in HTML. I’m still learning to use VIM but has found this [“MIT missing semester” video on VIM and text editor](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/editors/) particularly helpful
- `justify-content` is useful for placing multiple items in a harmonious way, space-around will place contents with equal distance apart and half distance to the borders
```
#pond {
	display: flex;
	justify-content: space-around;
}
```
