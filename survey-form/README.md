## Learning Notes
- In VSCode, when editting html, after typing = , VSCode will create the quotes automatically and put the prompt in between the quotes. No need to type the quote, because if you do, youâ€™ll find your prompt outside of the pair of quotes, then having to go backward inside the quote is rather inconvenient. This reddit thread explains this behavior very well.
- `justify-content` is useful for placing multiple items in a harmonious way, space-around will place contents with equal distance apart and half distance to the borders
```
#pond {
	display: flex;
	justify-content: space-around;
}
```
