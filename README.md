# Background
The goal of this repo is documenting my journey for learning web development. I do have some background on JavaScript, React and programming, though rather rusty. My goal is to learn by doing and become competent enough to create web app products as an indie hacker.

# The Plan
So for the next 100 days, I will create projects based on FreeCodeCamp courses:
- [Responsive Web Design course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) 17 projects
- [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#functional-programming) 5 projects
- [Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/) 5 projects
- [Back End Development and APIs Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/) 5 projects

# For staying motivated:
- join the 100 days of code challenge
    - tweet everyday on what I learned, tag #100daysofcode
    - search for 2 ppl with that tag and reply to them
- participate in [free code camp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/categories)
    - post what i learned
    - find 2 posts where i could help and reply them. maybe by searching on the topics I just learned
